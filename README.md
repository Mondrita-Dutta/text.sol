## üöÄ Project Description

The **Decentralized Note Storing System** is a blockchain-based application that allows users to securely manage small pieces of text data (notes) in a transparent and immutable way.  
Each Ethereum or Celo wallet address can store **one note**, which can be updated anytime by the owner.

This project demonstrates core concepts of blockchain development:
- Smart contract functions  
- Data storage using mappings  
- Events and user interactions  
- Transparency and decentralization  

---

## üí° What It Does

- Allows any blockchain user to **store** a note on-chain.  
- Users can **update** or **replace** their note at any time.  
- Other users can **view** publicly available notes.  
- Stores notes **forever** on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
